# Hypernym API Integration Setup

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the `orbit-stats/` directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Hypernym API Configuration
HYPERNYM_API_KEY=aleMLv219AAkriaT
HYPERNYM_API_ENDPOINT=https://fc-api-development-b.hypernym.ai

# Next.js App Configuration  
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

## What's Been Integrated

The `/explore` page now has **functional Hypernym API integration** with the existing UI kept exactly as is:

### ‚úÖ Features Added:

1. **Real-time Content Analysis**: When you search for topics, the content is analyzed using Hypernym's FieldConstrictor API
2. **Smart Content Enhancement**: Mock content (Twitter posts, news articles, research reports) gets enhanced with semantic analysis
3. **Loading States**: Search button shows "Analyzing..." when processing
4. **Success/Error Feedback**: Toast notifications for API responses
5. **Categorization**: Content gets categorized with narratives, themes, and confidence scores

### üîß How It Works:

1. **Search Functionality**: When you type a search query and click "Search" or press Enter:
   - The query gets analyzed by Hypernym API
   - Existing content gets enhanced with semantic categorization
   - Results show in real-time with toast notifications

2. **Content Enhancement**: All mock content (Twitter, News, Research) gets analyzed for:
   - Primary categories (DeFi, Layer 2, AI, etc.)
   - Narrative themes
   - Confidence scores
   - Keyword extraction

3. **API Integration**: 
   - Uses existing API routes: `/api/hypernym/analyze` and `/api/hypernym/categorize`
   - Connects to the hypernymService configured with the correct API key
   - Handles errors gracefully with fallback to mock data

### üéØ Usage:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd orbit-stats
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the `/explore` page
3. Select a project from the dropdown (e.g., "Eigenlayer")
4. Type a search query (e.g., "restaking", "staking derivatives") 
5. Click "Search" or press Enter
6. Watch the analysis happen in real-time

### üîç What You'll See:

- Loading state on Search button ("Analyzing...")
- Success toast: "Content Analyzed - Found X categories and Y keywords"
- Enhanced content with semantic analysis in the background
- All existing UI elements work exactly as before

The integration is **completely non-intrusive** - all existing UI is preserved while adding powerful Hypernym analysis capabilities behind the scenes.
